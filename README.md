Have you ever been overwhelmed by millions of news generated on various news platforms every day? We understand that this is a fast pacing world. People would like a quick and straightforward way to view the big events that are going on recently. Our project provides a word cloud based on trending news and user preference.

## Key Features

### In a Rush? A Word Cloud 

### Interested? Search or See Related News

Users can click on any word in the word cloud to search for this word in google news. There will also be a list containing all words in the word cloud that can take users to a compiled list of articles related to each word.  

### Only Interested in Some News? Edit Preference

Users can select their preference to only view certain news sources or certain types of news. There are 11 news sources to (multi-)select from (We will add more!). Sorting can be based on Keywords, High Frequency Words, or Sentiment. Users might only be interested in the news within 24hr, 48hr, or 72hr. The amount of words listed can be in a range from 0-60. There are also 25 different news categories for users to choose from.

## Technical Details

### Web Scraper

We use a web scraper for extracting news articles using the [Newspaper3k](https://newspaper.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) package in python. 

### Data Storage

### Natural Language Processing

All natural language processing features in this project are implemented using the [Google Natural Language API](https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/). We implemented word extraction and sentiment analysis.
